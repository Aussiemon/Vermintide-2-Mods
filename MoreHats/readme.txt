Description: Some hats are safe to use with other heroes. This mod adds owned, compatible hats to those characters' equipment lists, and allows you to unequip hats by attempting to equip them twice.

Equipped (and unequipped) hats are visible to unmodded players in the lobby without issue. Some hats may display strangely on other characters.
